Reflection:
	Functionality requested by the project page is present.  I am probably going to make the console prompt include a current directory.  I would also like to refactor History to remove the two global variables found in history.c.  Checking how accurate the RNG on random process killing would be nice, but I do not care for 'rand(void)' very much at all.  This iteration of Smash works as intended, but could use a little WD40.
