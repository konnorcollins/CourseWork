Grade: 54/70
=================================
- Git repo (backpack) is all up to date and git status returns clean.  5/5 pts.
  - git pull
  - git status
	Everything is clean and up to date when git pull and git status is called.

- Part 1	15/15 pts
  - Modularity/Readability.
	Code is well modularized. Plenty of useful comments in areas which might 
	be confusing to follow as well.

- Part 2	21/36 pts
  - Command history
	History command works as expected. Memory is properly allocated and freed.
	The only problem is there is no way to detect if the history buffer is full.
	If you enter over 256 commands the code will break.
  - Is there a maximum number of entries?
	Yes, 256.
  - What happens when you hit the maximum?
	The code breaks.
	

- Code quality 	 13/14 pts
  - Valgrind (6/7) 
	History command passes valgrind, no memory leaks on program exit. Some issues
	however with the cd command
  - Can I understand the code? (7/7)


- Reflection

  Planned fixes for tonight prior to deadline:
  	  Error checking on  chdir command - an error occurs when you pass a null pointer to the function.
	  Error checking on an overflowing history array.  Rather than crashing completely, it should simply either overwrite the last entry or not write at all.
